            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Version Control System (VCS), which is a system that records changes to files or a set of files over time and allows for the users to recall past versions of that file. Compared to other types of VCSs, Git views data as a ‘stream of snapshots’ and only stores one file at a time to be efficient. Git has many benefits such as the locality of files and resources, therefore not needing to be connected to a network to function,  does not lose contents of files, does not allow for the changing of files without Git making note of it, and does not allow for the deletion of data and potential loss of data.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The history of Git begins with its relationship with Linux and the importance of keeping records of software and their previous versions. Git was developed by the Linux community and Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux as a tool for developers which would improve on previous unofficial VCSs, like BitKeeper. With BitKeeper having many issues and inevitably breaking down, Git was created with the issues of BitKeeper in mind. The focus was to create a VCS with a simple design, openly and fully distributed, fast in process, and able to handle large projects with ease. To this day, it is one of the most efficient means of version control. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">and Why It Is Important</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is something important to every developer. While a developer could create their own directory and time stamp their files, but this has the potential to be very error prone. With a VCS, a developer could use a program to save every version of an image, program, or other data without fear of those previous versions being deleted or saved over. If anyone changes the version without your permission, you would still be able to revert to a previous state without any difficulty at all. Most people do not realize the importance of version control until they are stuck with a version of data that they do not want and have no way of reversing that data. </p>

            <p></p>
                <span class="text-muted">Pros and Cons</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three different types of version control systems that are offered and each has its pros and cons. The first and the most popular are the local version control system, which includes a version database that can collect versions of a file locally without need of a network. The next is a centralized version control system in which multiple users on a network using multiple computers can work on the same file and update the current version but keeps a version list. The downsides of the centralized VCS are that if the network goes down then no one can collaborate during the time that network goes down, and if that central database corrupts then everything is lost. Lastly is the distributed version control system is one which backups of versions both in a separate database and stored on computers kept on that system. This allows for the network to go down and for versions to continue to be updated and archived.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">of the VCS 'Git' </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three basic commands of the version control system Git is add, commit, and push. First, you add the new data to the staging area. Then you want to commit it to the local repository and then finally push it to the remote repository where that data version will be stored until needed by the user. In this case, if you are working on a project then you can add those new files to the local storage and then inevitably pushed to that remote repository where it can be held. Then when you change that information again, the same process occurs of add, commit, and then pushing that information to update the version in the repositories. </p>
