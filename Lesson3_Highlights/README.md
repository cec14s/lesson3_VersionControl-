## Project Description 
Lesson #3 was about version control systems (VCSs) and specifically the popular VSC named Git. We will learn about what version control systems are, their importance, and the different types. Then, we will learn about the brief history of Git, the basics, and the add, commit, and push commands. The assignment is to write brief summaries of each of the aforementioned topics that were important to the lesson and substitute images in the bootstrap index.html.
## Lessons Learned in this Assignment 
1. The importance of version control and how having version control systems is a much more trustworthy and has much less room for error then directly saving files to your computer. It is much easier for version to be saved by a program then to accidentally saving over files and losing data.
2. The different types of version control systems, the best ones to use in certain scenerios, and the introduction of Git, a system that I was completely unaware of prior to this lesson that could prove to be important to me in my every day developing. 
3.  The various commands of **Git** and the three basic steps of add, commit, and push which are used to save versions to both the local repository and then the outsourced repository.
